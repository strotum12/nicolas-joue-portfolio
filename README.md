## About The Project

This portfolio was created not just as a resume, but as a living project to demonstrate my skills in modern web development alongside my core expertise in AI and Data Science. The primary goal was to build a clean, professional, and high-performance platform to present my work to potential employers and collaborators.

Every component, from the interactive project cards to the page transitions, was intentionally designed to provide a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Live Demo

The portfolio is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed directly.

## Key Features

-   **Fully Responsive Design**: A seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   **Interactive Project Filtering**: Users can filter projects by category (academic/personal) and by year.
-   **Animated Page Transitions**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions between pages using `framer-motion` for an app-like feel.
-   **Dynamic Content**: Project and career data are managed centrally in a dedicated data file, making the site easy to update.
-   **SEO Optimized**: Each page includes unique titles and meta descriptions, with structured data (Schema.org) for better understanding by search engines and AI.
-   **Interactive UI Elements**: Animated status badges, hover effects, and a custom 404 page enhance the user experience.

## Design & Structure

The site is structured to separate concerns effectively:
-   **`/pages`**: Contains all the routes of the application.
-   **`/components`**: Holds reusable React components like the Header, Footer, and Layout.
-   **`/data`**: Centralizes all portfolio content (projects, timeline) for easy maintenance.
-   **`/styles`**: Includes a `globals.css` file for site-wide styles and CSS modules for component-specific styling.
-   **`/public`**: Stores all static assets like images, logos, and the CV file.

This structure ensures that the project remains organized and scalable.
